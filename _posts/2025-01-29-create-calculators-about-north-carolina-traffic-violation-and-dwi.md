## Development Methodology

We successfully developed two specialized legal calculators: the [North Carolina Traffic Violation Calculator](https://www.freecalculators.app/legal/north-carolina/traffic-violation-calculator) and the [North Carolina DWI Sentencing Calculator](https://www.freecalculators.app/legal/north-carolina/dwi-sentencing-calculator).

Our development process follows a systematic approach:

1. **Market Research**: Utilize Semrush to identify high-volume search keywords and analyze market demand
2. **Legal Research**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of relevant statutes and legal precedents
3. **AI-Assisted Development**: 
   - Compile research materials and upload to ChatGPT for analysis
   - Generate optimized prompts using ChatGPT
   - Implement code generation through Cursor IDE
4. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing of all features with iterative bug fixes

## Development Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges Encountered

**Markdown Compilation Issues**: 
- Special characters like "<" and ">" in markdown files cause compilation errors
- Error example: `Unexpected character '1' (U+0031) before name, expected a character that can start a name, such as a letter, '$', or '_'`

**Complex Testing Requirements**:
The North Carolina Traffic Violation calculator contains numerous calculation conditions, making manual testing extremely time-consuming. This prompted us to explore AI-assisted testing solutions.

### AI-Powered Testing Solution

With the recent release of ChatGPT Atlas, we integrated this powerful tool into our testing workflow. The results exceeded expectations, significantly reducing testing time while maintaining accuracy and thoroughness.

### Critical Issues Identified by ChatGPT Atlas
> It is excessively harsh to classify a single serious aggravating factor — such as the presence of a minor passenger or an accident involving injury or death — directly as Aggravated Level 1.
> 
> • Two ordinary aggravating factors are assigned to Level 2, without considering any mitigating factors for balance.
> 
> • A single prior DWI offense is also directly treated as Level 1, instead of Level 2.
> 
> These classifications do not align with the level structure established by the statute.

### Resolution Process

Upon identifying these critical issues, we conducted additional research to verify the statutory requirements, consulted ChatGPT for legal interpretation guidance, and systematically resolved all identified discrepancies.

## Conclusion

The integration of ChatGPT and ChatGPT Atlas into our development workflow has proven invaluable for building complex legal calculation tools. These AI-powered solutions not only accelerate development but also enhance accuracy through comprehensive testing and validation.
